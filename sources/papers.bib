	Abstract = {This paper presents a formal analysis of FIDO, a protocol developed by the FIDO Alliance project, and which aims to provide either a passwordless experience or an extra security layer for user authentication over the Internet. We model the protocol using the applied pi-calculus and run our analysis using ProVerif. Our analysis shows that ignoring some optional steps of the standard could lead to the implementation of a flawed authentication process. On the contrary, we prove that these steps are sufficient to ensure the expected security properties.},

	Abstract = {``Security Keys'' are second-factor devices that protect users against phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. Users carry a single device and can self-register it with any online service that supports the protocol. The devices are simple to implement and deploy, simple to use, privacy preserving, and secure against strong attackers. We have shipped support for Security Keys in the Chrome web browser and in Google's online services. We show that Security Keys lead to both an increased level of security and user satisfaction by analyzing a two year deployment which began within Google and has extended to our consumer-facing web applications. The Security Key design has been standardized by the FIDO Alliance, an organization with more than 250 member companies spanning the industry. Currently, Security Keys have been deployed by Google, Dropbox, and GitHub. An updated and extended tech report is available at https://github.com/google/u2f-ref-code/docs/SecurityKeys{\_}TechReport.pdf.},

Its goal is to simplify and strengthen online user authentication by relying on local device user authentication. Another goal is to finally put passwords to rest. This solution requires strong trust between players and components in the architecture. These aspects have received little attention from the FIDO consortium. The aim of this paper is to analyze the trust requirements for FIDO, and assess the cost of establishing the required trust.},

	Abstract = {The FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Universal Authentication Framework is a new authentication mechanism that replaces passwords, simplifying the process of user authentication. To this end, FIDO transfers user verification tasks from the authentication server to the user's personal device. Therefore, the overall assurance level of user authentication is highly dependent on the security and integrity of the user's device involved. This paper analyses the functionality of FIDO's UAF protocol and identifies a list of critical vulnerabilities that may compromise the authenticity, privacy, availability, and integrity of the UAF protocol, allowing an attacker to launch a number of attacks, such as, capturing the data exchanged between a user and an online service, impersonating a user at any UAF compatible online service, impersonating online services to the user, and presenting fake information to the user's screen during a transaction.},

	Abstract = {Digital identity is the ground necessary to guarantee that the Internet infrastructure is strong enough to meet basic expectations such as security and privacy. Anywhere anytime mobile computing is becoming true. In this ambient intelligent world, the choice of the identity management mechanisms will have a large impact on social, cultural, business and political aspects: privacy is a human need and the all of society would suffer from the demise of privacy; people have hectic life and cannot spend their whole time administering their digital identities. The choice of identity mechanisms will change the social, cultural, business and political environment. Furthermore, the identity management is also a promising topic for modern society. In the first version of this book chapter, it seemed that identity management would be based on the paradigm of federated identity management and user-centric identity management. The first one empowers the management of identity and the second the users to actively manage their identity information and profiles. A time of writing this second edition of the chapter, although the technical building blocks detailed in this chapter remains and are improved, they are hidden under a number of major online social networks providers (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter{\ldots}) where users have already created their account and use this account to automatically log into less well-known online Web sites and services. Firstly, we provide an overview of identity management from identity 1.0 to identity 2.0 and higher, with emphasis on user centric approaches. Also we survey how have evolved the requirements for user-centric identity management and their associated technologies with emphasis on the federated approaches and user-centricity. Secondly, we will focus on related standards XRI and LID issued from Yadis project, and platforms mainly ID-WSF, OpenID, InfoCard, Sxip and Higgins. Thirdly, we discuss user management through ``social login'' that seems to be the only approach that has won large user adoption and that was not expected at time of writing the first edition of this book chapter. At the end, we cover identity management for mobile settings and focus on the future of mobile identity management.},

	Abstract = {This chapter explains why designing biometric systems is actually a very difficult problem. The problem has been made to look easier than it actually is by the way the technology has been portrayed in movies and on television. Biometric systems are typically depicted as being easy to use and secure, whereas encryption that would actually take billions of years of supercomputer time to defeat is often depicted as being easily bypassed with minimal effort. This portrayal of biometric systems may have increased expectations well past what current technologies can actually deliver, and it is important to understand the limitations of existing biometric technologies and to have realistic expectations of the security that such systems can provide in the real world.},

	Abstract = {In our modern information age, recent technical developments and trends, such as mobile and pervasive computing, big data, cloud computing, and Web 2.0 applications, increasingly pose privacy dilemmas. Due to the low costs and technical advances of storage technologies, masses of personal data can easily be stored. Once disclosed, these data may be retained forever, often without the knowledge of the individuals concerned, and be removed with difficulty. Hence, it has become hard for individuals to manage and control their personal spheres. Both legal and technical means are needed to protect privacy and to (re-)establish the individuals' control. This chapter provides an overview to the area of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), which help to protect privacy by technically enforcing legal privacy principles. It will start with defining the legal foundations of PETs, and will present a classification of PETs as well as a definition of traditional privacy properties that PETs are addressing and metrics for measuring the level of privacy that PETs are providing. Then, a selection of the most relevant PETs is presented.},

	Abstract = {Multifactor authentication is one of the de facto standards for systems requiring strong security. In most cases, multifactor authentication is complex and not user-friendly because it requires additional steps as far as end users are concerned. With two-factor authentication, in addition to entering a username and a password (first factor), users need to enter an additional code (second factor) manually that they receive by short message service or look up in a previously printed list of passwords, or that is generated by a hardware or software token. So, although introducing additional authentication factors greatly increases the level of security, it could also become frustrating for end users. This chapter reviews a wide variety of modern and classic multifactor authentication systems and methods.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we extend the notion of interactive proofs of assertions to interactive proofs of knowledge. This leads to the definition of unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge in which the prover demonstrates possession of knowledge without revealing any computational information whatsoever (not even the one bit revealed in zero-knowledge proofs of assertions). We show the relevance of these notions to identification schemes, in which parties prove their identity by demonstrating their knowledge rather than by proving the validity of assertions. We describe a novel scheme which is provably secure if factoring is difficult and whose practical implementations are about two orders of magnitude faster than RSA-based identification schemes. The advantages of thinking in terms of proofs of knowledge rather than proofs of assertions are demonstrated in two efficient variants of the scheme: unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge are used in the construction of a scheme which needs no directory; a version of the scheme based on parallel interactive proofs (which are not known to be zero knowledge) is proved secure by observing that the identification protocols are proofs of knowledge.},

	Abstract = {Online game security is often discussed, but, in game development, security factors are tend to be an afterthought. It is helpful to consider the unique perspectives of the game designer, security engineer, and game player all together in the game development process. In this paper, we present a framework for a formal approach to understand the security interface. We also try to integrate different perspectives when analyzing cases which use a hardware security token for online games. This interface-level analysis of security attempts to achieve two goals: Firstly, to make the security in online gaming not merely an add-on feature but an integrated part of game development. Secondly, to bridge the gap between game design and security technology and allow the game designer and security engineer to collaborate toward their particular goals.},

	Abstract = {The classical way of authentication with a username-password pair is often insufficient: an adversary can choose from a multitude of methods to obtain the credentials, e.g., by guessing passwords using a dictionary, by eavesdropping on network traffic, or by installing malware on the system of the target user. To overcome this problem, numerous solutions incorporating a second factor in the authentication process have been proposed. A particularly wide-spread approach provides each user with a hardware token that generates a One-Time Password (OTP) in addition to the traditional credentials. The token itself comprises a secret cryptographic key that, together with timestamps and counters, is used to derive a fresh OTP for each authentication. A relatively new yet wide-spread example for an OTP token is the Yubikey 2 produced by Yubico. This device employs an open-source protocol based on the mathematically secure AES and emulates a USB keyboard to enter the OTP in a platform-independent manner. In this paper, we analyse the susceptibility of the Yubikey 2 to side-channel attacks. We show that by non-invasively measuring the power consumption and the electro-magnetic emanation of the device, an adversary is able to extract the full 128-bit AES key with approximately one hour of access to the Yubikey 2. The attack leaves no physical traces on the device and can be performed using low-cost equipment. In consequence, an adversary is able to generate valid OTPs, even after the Yubikey 2 has been returned to the owner.},

	Abstract = {January 2018 introduced significant change for both the banking and cyber-security industries due to the introduction of the EU's updated Payment Service Directive (PSD). The mandate, known as the PSD2, enables all bank customers, both consumers and businesses, to use third-party providers to manage their finances. Despite mobile operating systems actively discouraging the linking of applications, in order to ensure data protection banks are now obligated to provide application programme interfaces (APIs) to allow third-party providers access to their customers' accounts. The new PSD2 enables all bank customers to use third-party providers to manage their finances, meaning that banks are now obligated to provide application programme interfaces (APIs) to allow third-party providers access to customers' accounts. Mark Noctor of Arxan Technologies asks how secure this approach will be, as well as what risks will arise and for whom.},

	Abstract = {We consider the security of message authentication code (MAC) algorithms, and the construction of MACs from fast hash functions. A new forgery attack applicable to all iterated MAC algorithms is described, the first known such attack requiring fewer operations than exhaustive key search. Existing methods for constructing MACs from hash functions, including the secret prefix, secret suffix, and envelope methods, are shown to be unsatisfactory. Motivated by the absence of a secure, fast MAC algorithm not based on encryption, a new generic construction (MDx-MAC) is proposed for transforming any secure hash function of the MD4-family into a secure MAC of equal or smaller bitlength and comparable speed.},

Despite its widespread adoption (over a million devices have been shipped by Yubico to more than 20 000 customers including Google and Microsoft), the Yubikey protocols have received relatively little security analysis in the academic literature. In the first part of this paper, we give a formal model for the operation of the Yubikey one-time password (OTP) protocol. We prove security properties of the protocol for an unbounded number of fresh OTPs using a protocol analysis tool, tamarin.},

	Abstract = {Major Internet service providers deploy SMS-based verification mechanisms to fortify the security of users' accounts for critical actions such as password reset and logging in from a new computer. In this paper, we describe a new type of phishing attack where an attacker triggers the delivery of a verification code from a service provider to a user and lures the user to forward the code to him so that he can bypass the SMS verification process. We call this a Verification Code Forwarding Attack (VCFA). The attacker can use VCFA to reset a password of a user's account or to get access to a 2-factor enabled account which he already knows its password (e.g., through leaked databases). We attribute the success of this attack to the lack of an effective and usable means for users to verify the service provider, the lack of context for the message sent, and an assumption about users' understanding of the authentication process. To show the susceptibility of the users to such an attack, we conducted an experiment with 20 mobile phone users and found that more than 25 {\%} of users were vulnerable against this type of attack. A semi-structured interview with the subjects of the experiment and a survey of 100 subjects on Amazon Mechanical Turk were done to explore possible causes for the success of this type of attack. We also discuss possible remediation.},

	Abstract = {Mobile devices have become almost ever-present in our daily lives and increasingly so in the professional workplace. Applications put company data, personal information and sensitive documents in the hands of busy nurses at hospitals, company employees on business trips and government workers at large conferences. Smartphones and tablets also not only store data on-device, but users are frequently authorized to access sensitive information in the cloud. Protecting the sensitivity of mobile devices yet not burdening users with complicated and cumbersome active authentication methods is of great importance to the security and convenience of mobile computing. In this paper, we propose a novel passive authentication method; we model the micro-behavior of mobile users' interaction with their devices' soft keyboard. We show that the way a user types---the specific location touched on each key, the drift from finger down to finger up, the force of touch, the area of press---reflects their unique physical and behavioral characteristics. We demonstrate that using these micro-behavior features without any contextual information, we can passively identify that a mobile device is being used by a non-authorized user within 5 keypresses 67.7{\%} of the time. This comes with a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 32.3{\%} and a False Rejection Rate (FRR) of only 4.6{\%}. Our detection rate after 15 keypresses is 86{\%} with a FAR of 14{\%} and a FRR of only 2.2{\%}.},

	Abstract = {The session initiation protocol (SIP) is a signaling communications protocol, which is widely used for controlling multimedia communication sessions. Recently, Yeh et al. presented an ECC-based authenticated protocol for SIP to conquer various attacks which were found in earlier schemes. In this paper, we analyze the security of Yeh et al.'s scheme and identify that Yeh et al.'s scheme is insecure. We demonstrate the vulnerability of Yeh et al.'s scheme to resist off-line password guessing attack, and their scheme also lacks the forward secrecy. We aim to propose an efficient improvement on Yeh et al.'s scheme to overcome the security weaknesses found in Yeh et al.'s scheme, while retaining the original merits. Through the rigorous informal security analysis and the formal security analysis using the widely-accepted Burrows--Abadi--Needham logic (BAN logic), we show that our scheme is secure against various known attacks including the attacks found in Yeh et al.'s scheme. Furthermore, we simulate our scheme for the formal security analysis using the widely-accepted AVISPA (automated validation of internet security protocols and applications) tool, and show that our scheme is secure against passive and active attacks including the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, our proposed scheme is efficient in terms of the communication and computational overheads as compared to Yeh et al.'s scheme and other related existing schemes. To demonstrate the practicality of the scheme, we evaluate the proposed scheme using the broadly-accepted NS-2 network simulator.},

In parallel with this evolution, most service providers understand the need to support traditional Signalling System No.7 (SS7) and SIGTRAN protocols for the foreseeable future. With the buzz of 5G, it's easy to underestimate the relevance of the SS7 network. More importantly, it's even easier to forget the vulnerabilities that have always existed.},

	Abstract = {Cybercrime analysis reports state that the crime percentage has been doubled from past 3 to 4 years, and most of the crimes are being successful due to the lack of proper identity verification mechanism that is nothing but the authenticity verification mechanism. The authentication of the user can be done by various authentication protocols but still, the attacks are being success; this shows the necessity of improving the efficiency of the authentication algorithms, and this can be done accurately by analysis various existing mechanisms proposed by various researchers. On analyzing the various protocols of authentication, the loop pits of the existing schemes can be recorded, which gives an ideology of filling the loopholes of the same. Therefore, this paper analyzes the most recently proposed multifactor authentication scheme by Mishra et al. Based on various characteristics that are to be considered in designing an authentication protocol, the scheme is been analyzed. A detailed explanation of various vulnerabilities of Mishra et al.'s scheme is given in this paper.},

	Abstract = {Summary Two-factor user authentication scheme allows a user to use a smart card and a password to achieve mutual authentication and establish a session key between a server and a user. In 2012, Chen et al. showed that the scheme of Sood et al. does not achieve mutual authentication and is vulnerable to off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks. They also found that another scheme proposed by Song is vulnerable to similar off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks. They further proposed an improved scheme. In this paper, we first show that the improved scheme of Chen et al. still suffers from off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks, does not support perfect forward secrecy, and lacks the fairness of session key establishment. We then propose a new security-enhanced scheme and show its security and authentication using the formal verification tool ProVerif, which is based on applied pi calculus.

	Abstract = {SMS-based One-Time Passwords (SMS OTP) were introduced to counter phishing and other attacks against Internet services such as online banking. Today, SMS OTPs are commonly used for authentication and authorization for many different applications. Recently, SMS OTPs have come under heavy attack, especially by smartphone Trojans. In this paper, we analyze the security architecture of SMS OTP systems and study attacks that pose a threat to Internet-based authentication and authorization services. We determined that the two foundations SMS OTP is built on, cellular networks and mobile handsets, were completely different at the time when SMS OTP was designed and introduced. Throughout this work, we show why SMS OTP systems cannot be considered secure anymore. Based on our findings, we propose mechanisms to secure SMS OTPs against common attacks and specifically against smartphone Trojans.},

	Abstract = {One of the most important parts of any system is authentication. Appreciated as the first and the last line of defense in the great majority of cases, authentication systems can usually prevent the kleptomaniac from unauthorized accessing to users' data. However, the traditional text-based password is still used in many websites and applications which are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks. Accordingly, there exist some other alternative ways to boost this traditional method. In this study, we classified and identified different types of authentication systems in a variety of platforms. Their usage, similarity, usability, performance and drawbacks were discussed. The goal of this study is to provide useful, classified information with the aim of understanding of how different authentication systems work and of what their usability and drawbacks are to the readers.},

	Abstract = {There are countless ways to carry out a cyber-attack, but in the vast majority the key is deception -- typically involving identity deception in which the attacker poses as a trusted party to the intended victim. Many of these attacks involve stealing passwords from victims in order to access their accounts and pose as them. Therefore, with cyber-criminals constantly on the prowl to capture passwords and other credentials, two-factor authentication (2FA) has become one of the most widely accepted back-up verifications for many services and companies. With cyber-criminals constantly on the prowl to capture passwords and other credentials, two-factor authentication (2FA) has become one of the most widely accepted back-up verifications for many services and companies. However, as Markus Jakobsson of Agari points out, 2FA has its own issues. Other options are on the way, but it's more important than ever for organisations to be aware that their workforce's digital identities may be compromised.},

	Abstract = {Two-factor authentication (2FA) schemes aim at strengthening the security of login password-based authentication by deploying secondary authentication tokens. In this context, mobile 2FA schemes require no additional hardware (e.g., a smartcard) to store and handle the secondary authentication token, and hence are considered as a reasonable trade-off between security, usability and costs. They are widely used in online banking and increasingly deployed by Internet service providers. In this paper, we investigate 2FA implementations of several well-known Internet service providers such as Google, Dropbox, Twitter and Facebook. We identify various weaknesses that allow an attacker to easily bypass them, even when the secondary authentication token is not under attacker's control. We then go a step further and present a more general attack against mobile 2FA schemes. Our attack relies on cross-platform infection that subverts control over both end points (PC and a mobile device) involved in the authentication protocol. We apply this attack in practice and successfully circumvent diverse schemes: SMS-based TAN solutions of four large banks, one instance of a visual TAN scheme, 2FA login verification systems of Google, Dropbox, Twitter and Facebook accounts, and the Google Authenticator app currently used by 32 third-party service providers. Finally, we cluster and analyze hundreds of real-world malicious Android apps that target mobile 2FA schemes and show that banking Trojans already deploy mobile counterparts that steal 2FA credentials like TANs.},

	Abstract = {Due to the success of formal modeling of protocols such as TLS, there is a revival of interest in applying formal modeling to standardized APIs. We argue that formal modeling should happen as the standard is being developed (not afterwards) as it can detect complex or even simple attacks that the standardization group may not otherwise detect. As a case example of this, we discuss in detail the W3C Web Cryptography API. We demonstrate how a formal analysis of the API using the modeling language AVISPA with a SAT solver demonstrates that while the API has no errors in basic API operations and maintains its security properties for the most part, there are nonetheless attacks on secret key material due to how key wrapping and usages are implemented. Furthermore, there were a number of basic problems in terms of algorithm selection and a weakness that led to a padding attack. The results of this study led to the removal of algorithms before its completed standardization and the removal of the padding attack via normalization of error codes, although the key wrapping attack is still open. We expect this sort of formal methodology to be applied to new standardization efforts at the W3C such as the W3C Web Authentication API.},
