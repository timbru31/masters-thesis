	Abstract = {SecurID tokens are developed by SDTI/RSA Security to authenticate users to a corporate computer infrastructure. In this paper we show the results of our analysis of the function contained in these tokens. The block cipher at the heart of the function can be broken in milliseconds. We present two attack scenarios on the full function: if one can observe the output of the device during some time period, one can predict with high probability future output values and one can recover the secret key significantly faster than by exhaustive search.},

In parallel with this evolution, most service providers understand the need to support traditional Signalling System No.7 (SS7) and SIGTRAN protocols for the foreseeable future. With the buzz of 5G, it's easy to underestimate the relevance of the SS7 network. More importantly, it's even easier to forget the vulnerabilities that have always existed.},

	Abstract = {Cybercrime analysis reports state that the crime percentage has been doubled from past 3 to 4 years, and most of the crimes are being successful due to the lack of proper identity verification mechanism that is nothing but the authenticity verification mechanism. The authentication of the user can be done by various authentication protocols but still, the attacks are being success; this shows the necessity of improving the efficiency of the authentication algorithms, and this can be done accurately by analysis various existing mechanisms proposed by various researchers. On analyzing the various protocols of authentication, the loop pits of the existing schemes can be recorded, which gives an ideology of filling the loopholes of the same. Therefore, this paper analyzes the most recently proposed multifactor authentication scheme by Mishra et al. Based on various characteristics that are to be considered in designing an authentication protocol, the scheme is been analyzed. A detailed explanation of various vulnerabilities of Mishra et al.'s scheme is given in this paper.},

	Abstract = {Summary Two-factor user authentication scheme allows a user to use a smart card and a password to achieve mutual authentication and establish a session key between a server and a user. In 2012, Chen et al. showed that the scheme of Sood et al. does not achieve mutual authentication and is vulnerable to off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks. They also found that another scheme proposed by Song is vulnerable to similar off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks. They further proposed an improved scheme. In this paper, we first show that the improved scheme of Chen et al. still suffers from off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks, does not support perfect forward secrecy, and lacks the fairness of session key establishment. We then propose a new security-enhanced scheme and show its security and authentication using the formal verification tool ProVerif, which is based on applied pi calculus.

	Abstract = {SMS-based One-Time Passwords (SMS OTP) were introduced to counter phishing and other attacks against Internet services such as online banking. Today, SMS OTPs are commonly used for authentication and authorization for many different applications. Recently, SMS OTPs have come under heavy attack, especially by smartphone Trojans. In this paper, we analyze the security architecture of SMS OTP systems and study attacks that pose a threat to Internet-based authentication and authorization services. We determined that the two foundations SMS OTP is built on, cellular networks and mobile handsets, were completely different at the time when SMS OTP was designed and introduced. Throughout this work, we show why SMS OTP systems cannot be considered secure anymore. Based on our findings, we propose mechanisms to secure SMS OTPs against common attacks and specifically against smartphone Trojans.},

	Abstract = {One of the most important parts of any system is authentication. Appreciated as the first and the last line of defense in the great majority of cases, authentication systems can usually prevent the kleptomaniac from unauthorized accessing to users' data. However, the traditional text-based password is still used in many websites and applications which are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks. Accordingly, there exist some other alternative ways to boost this traditional method. In this study, we classified and identified different types of authentication systems in a variety of platforms. Their usage, similarity, usability, performance and drawbacks were discussed. The goal of this study is to provide useful, classified information with the aim of understanding of how different authentication systems work and of what their usability and drawbacks are to the readers.},

	Abstract = {There are countless ways to carry out a cyber-attack, but in the vast majority the key is deception -- typically involving identity deception in which the attacker poses as a trusted party to the intended victim. Many of these attacks involve stealing passwords from victims in order to access their accounts and pose as them. Therefore, with cyber-criminals constantly on the prowl to capture passwords and other credentials, two-factor authentication (2FA) has become one of the most widely accepted back-up verifications for many services and companies. With cyber-criminals constantly on the prowl to capture passwords and other credentials, two-factor authentication (2FA) has become one of the most widely accepted back-up verifications for many services and companies. However, as Markus Jakobsson of Agari points out, 2FA has its own issues. Other options are on the way, but it's more important than ever for organisations to be aware that their workforce's digital identities may be compromised.},

	Abstract = {SMS-based second factor authentication is a cornerstone for many service providers, ranging from email service providers and social networks to financial institutions and online marketplaces. Attackers have not been slow to capitalize on the vulnerabilities of this mechanism by using social engineering techniques to coerce users to forward authentication codes. We demonstrate one social engineering attack for which we experimentally obtained a 50% success rate against Google's SMS-based authentication. At the heart of the problem is the messaging associated with the authentication code, and how this must not have been developed with security against social engineering in mind. Pursuing a top-down methodology, we generate alternative messages and experimentally test these against an array of social engineering attempts. Our most robust messaging approach reduces the success of the most effective social engineering attack to 8%, or a sixth of its success against Google's standard second factor verification code messages.},

@inproceedings{10.1007/978-3-662-45472-5_24,
	Abstract = {Two-factor authentication (2FA) schemes aim at strengthening the security of login password-based authentication by deploying secondary authentication tokens. In this context, mobile 2FA schemes require no additional hardware (e.g., a smartcard) to store and handle the secondary authentication token, and hence are considered as a reasonable trade-off between security, usability and costs. They are widely used in online banking and increasingly deployed by Internet service providers. In this paper, we investigate 2FA implementations of several well-known Internet service providers such as Google, Dropbox, Twitter and Facebook. We identify various weaknesses that allow an attacker to easily bypass them, even when the secondary authentication token is not under attacker's control. We then go a step further and present a more general attack against mobile 2FA schemes. Our attack relies on cross-platform infection that subverts control over both end points (PC and a mobile device) involved in the authentication protocol. We apply this attack in practice and successfully circumvent diverse schemes: SMS-based TAN solutions of four large banks, one instance of a visual TAN scheme, 2FA login verification systems of Google, Dropbox, Twitter and Facebook accounts, and the Google Authenticator app currently used by 32 third-party service providers. Finally, we cluster and analyze hundreds of real-world malicious Android apps that target mobile 2FA schemes and show that banking Trojans already deploy mobile counterparts that steal 2FA credentials like TANs.},

@inproceedings{sec_analysis_webauthn,
	Abstract = {Due to the success of formal modeling of protocols such as TLS, there is a revival of interest in applying formal modeling to standardized APIs. We argue that formal modeling should happen as the standard is being developed (not afterwards) as it can detect complex or even simple attacks that the standardization group may not otherwise detect. As a case example of this, we discuss in detail the W3C Web Cryptography API. We demonstrate how a formal analysis of the API using the modeling language AVISPA with a SAT solver demonstrates that while the API has no errors in basic API operations and maintains its security properties for the most part, there are nonetheless attacks on secret key material due to how key wrapping and usages are implemented. Furthermore, there were a number of basic problems in terms of algorithm selection and a weakness that led to a padding attack. The results of this study led to the removal of algorithms before its completed standardization and the removal of the padding attack via normalization of error codes, although the key wrapping attack is still open. We expect this sort of formal methodology to be applied to new standardization efforts at the W3C such as the W3C Web Authentication API.},
