@article{NOCTOR20189,
	Abstract = {January 2018 introduced significant change for both the banking and cyber-security industries due to the introduction of the EU's updated Payment Service Directive (PSD). The mandate, known as the PSD2, enables all bank customers, both consumers and businesses, to use third-party providers to manage their finances. Despite mobile operating systems actively discouraging the linking of applications, in order to ensure data protection banks are now obligated to provide application programme interfaces (APIs) to allow third-party providers access to their customers' accounts. The new PSD2 enables all bank customers to use third-party providers to manage their finances, meaning that banks are now obligated to provide application programme interfaces (APIs) to allow third-party providers access to customers' accounts. Mark Noctor of Arxan Technologies asks how secure this approach will be, as well as what risks will arise and for whom.},

	Abstract = {We consider the security of message authentication code (MAC) algorithms, and the construction of MACs from fast hash functions. A new forgery attack applicable to all iterated MAC algorithms is described, the first known such attack requiring fewer operations than exhaustive key search. Existing methods for constructing MACs from hash functions, including the secret prefix, secret suffix, and envelope methods, are shown to be unsatisfactory. Motivated by the absence of a secure, fast MAC algorithm not based on encryption, a new generic construction (MDx-MAC) is proposed for transforming any secure hash function of the MD4-family into a secure MAC of equal or smaller bitlength and comparable speed.},

Despite its widespread adoption (over a million devices have been shipped by Yubico to more than 20 000 customers including Google and Microsoft), the Yubikey protocols have received relatively little security analysis in the academic literature. In the first part of this paper, we give a formal model for the operation of the Yubikey one-time password (OTP) protocol. We prove security properties of the protocol for an unbounded number of fresh OTPs using a protocol analysis tool, tamarin.},

	Abstract = {Major Internet service providers deploy SMS-based verification mechanisms to fortify the security of users' accounts for critical actions such as password reset and logging in from a new computer. In this paper, we describe a new type of phishing attack where an attacker triggers the delivery of a verification code from a service provider to a user and lures the user to forward the code to him so that he can bypass the SMS verification process. We call this a Verification Code Forwarding Attack (VCFA). The attacker can use VCFA to reset a password of a user's account or to get access to a 2-factor enabled account which he already knows its password (e.g., through leaked databases). We attribute the success of this attack to the lack of an effective and usable means for users to verify the service provider, the lack of context for the message sent, and an assumption about users' understanding of the authentication process. To show the susceptibility of the users to such an attack, we conducted an experiment with 20 mobile phone users and found that more than 25 {\%} of users were vulnerable against this type of attack. A semi-structured interview with the subjects of the experiment and a survey of 100 subjects on Amazon Mechanical Turk were done to explore possible causes for the success of this type of attack. We also discuss possible remediation.},

	Abstract = {Mobile devices have become almost ever-present in our daily lives and increasingly so in the professional workplace. Applications put company data, personal information and sensitive documents in the hands of busy nurses at hospitals, company employees on business trips and government workers at large conferences. Smartphones and tablets also not only store data on-device, but users are frequently authorized to access sensitive information in the cloud. Protecting the sensitivity of mobile devices yet not burdening users with complicated and cumbersome active authentication methods is of great importance to the security and convenience of mobile computing. In this paper, we propose a novel passive authentication method; we model the micro-behavior of mobile users' interaction with their devices' soft keyboard. We show that the way a user types---the specific location touched on each key, the drift from finger down to finger up, the force of touch, the area of press---reflects their unique physical and behavioral characteristics. We demonstrate that using these micro-behavior features without any contextual information, we can passively identify that a mobile device is being used by a non-authorized user within 5 keypresses 67.7{\%} of the time. This comes with a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 32.3{\%} and a False Rejection Rate (FRR) of only 4.6{\%}. Our detection rate after 15 keypresses is 86{\%} with a FAR of 14{\%} and a FRR of only 2.2{\%}.},

However, current authentication methods like password entry are significantly more frustrating and difficult to perform on these devices, leading users to create and reuse shorter passwords and pins, or no authentication at all. We present implicit authentication - authenticating users based on behavior patterns. We describe our model for performing implicit authentication and assess our techniques using more than two weeks of collected data from over 50 subjects.},

	Abstract = {The session initiation protocol (SIP) is a signaling communications protocol, which is widely used for controlling multimedia communication sessions. Recently, Yeh et al. presented an ECC-based authenticated protocol for SIP to conquer various attacks which were found in earlier schemes. In this paper, we analyze the security of Yeh et al.'s scheme and identify that Yeh et al.'s scheme is insecure. We demonstrate the vulnerability of Yeh et al.'s scheme to resist off-line password guessing attack, and their scheme also lacks the forward secrecy. We aim to propose an efficient improvement on Yeh et al.'s scheme to overcome the security weaknesses found in Yeh et al.'s scheme, while retaining the original merits. Through the rigorous informal security analysis and the formal security analysis using the widely-accepted Burrows--Abadi--Needham logic (BAN logic), we show that our scheme is secure against various known attacks including the attacks found in Yeh et al.'s scheme. Furthermore, we simulate our scheme for the formal security analysis using the widely-accepted AVISPA (automated validation of internet security protocols and applications) tool, and show that our scheme is secure against passive and active attacks including the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, our proposed scheme is efficient in terms of the communication and computational overheads as compared to Yeh et al.'s scheme and other related existing schemes. To demonstrate the practicality of the scheme, we evaluate the proposed scheme using the broadly-accepted NS-2 network simulator.},

In parallel with this evolution, most service providers understand the need to support traditional Signalling System No.7 (SS7) and SIGTRAN protocols for the foreseeable future. With the buzz of 5G, it's easy to underestimate the relevance of the SS7 network. More importantly, it's even easier to forget the vulnerabilities that have always existed.},

	Abstract = {Cybercrime analysis reports state that the crime percentage has been doubled from past 3 to 4 years, and most of the crimes are being successful due to the lack of proper identity verification mechanism that is nothing but the authenticity verification mechanism. The authentication of the user can be done by various authentication protocols but still, the attacks are being success; this shows the necessity of improving the efficiency of the authentication algorithms, and this can be done accurately by analysis various existing mechanisms proposed by various researchers. On analyzing the various protocols of authentication, the loop pits of the existing schemes can be recorded, which gives an ideology of filling the loopholes of the same. Therefore, this paper analyzes the most recently proposed multifactor authentication scheme by Mishra et al. Based on various characteristics that are to be considered in designing an authentication protocol, the scheme is been analyzed. A detailed explanation of various vulnerabilities of Mishra et al.'s scheme is given in this paper.},

	Abstract = {Summary Two-factor user authentication scheme allows a user to use a smart card and a password to achieve mutual authentication and establish a session key between a server and a user. In 2012, Chen et al. showed that the scheme of Sood et al. does not achieve mutual authentication and is vulnerable to off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks. They also found that another scheme proposed by Song is vulnerable to similar off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks. They further proposed an improved scheme. In this paper, we first show that the improved scheme of Chen et al. still suffers from off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks, does not support perfect forward secrecy, and lacks the fairness of session key establishment. We then propose a new security-enhanced scheme and show its security and authentication using the formal verification tool ProVerif, which is based on applied pi calculus.

	Abstract = {SMS-based One-Time Passwords (SMS OTP) were introduced to counter phishing and other attacks against Internet services such as online banking. Today, SMS OTPs are commonly used for authentication and authorization for many different applications. Recently, SMS OTPs have come under heavy attack, especially by smartphone Trojans. In this paper, we analyze the security architecture of SMS OTP systems and study attacks that pose a threat to Internet-based authentication and authorization services. We determined that the two foundations SMS OTP is built on, cellular networks and mobile handsets, were completely different at the time when SMS OTP was designed and introduced. Throughout this work, we show why SMS OTP systems cannot be considered secure anymore. Based on our findings, we propose mechanisms to secure SMS OTPs against common attacks and specifically against smartphone Trojans.},

	Abstract = {One of the most important parts of any system is authentication. Appreciated as the first and the last line of defense in the great majority of cases, authentication systems can usually prevent the kleptomaniac from unauthorized accessing to users' data. However, the traditional text-based password is still used in many websites and applications which are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks. Accordingly, there exist some other alternative ways to boost this traditional method. In this study, we classified and identified different types of authentication systems in a variety of platforms. Their usage, similarity, usability, performance and drawbacks were discussed. The goal of this study is to provide useful, classified information with the aim of understanding of how different authentication systems work and of what their usability and drawbacks are to the readers.},

	Abstract = {There are countless ways to carry out a cyber-attack, but in the vast majority the key is deception -- typically involving identity deception in which the attacker poses as a trusted party to the intended victim. Many of these attacks involve stealing passwords from victims in order to access their accounts and pose as them. Therefore, with cyber-criminals constantly on the prowl to capture passwords and other credentials, two-factor authentication (2FA) has become one of the most widely accepted back-up verifications for many services and companies. With cyber-criminals constantly on the prowl to capture passwords and other credentials, two-factor authentication (2FA) has become one of the most widely accepted back-up verifications for many services and companies. However, as Markus Jakobsson of Agari points out, 2FA has its own issues. Other options are on the way, but it's more important than ever for organisations to be aware that their workforce's digital identities may be compromised.},

	Abstract = {Two-factor authentication (2FA) schemes aim at strengthening the security of login password-based authentication by deploying secondary authentication tokens. In this context, mobile 2FA schemes require no additional hardware (e.g., a smartcard) to store and handle the secondary authentication token, and hence are considered as a reasonable trade-off between security, usability and costs. They are widely used in online banking and increasingly deployed by Internet service providers. In this paper, we investigate 2FA implementations of several well-known Internet service providers such as Google, Dropbox, Twitter and Facebook. We identify various weaknesses that allow an attacker to easily bypass them, even when the secondary authentication token is not under attacker's control. We then go a step further and present a more general attack against mobile 2FA schemes. Our attack relies on cross-platform infection that subverts control over both end points (PC and a mobile device) involved in the authentication protocol. We apply this attack in practice and successfully circumvent diverse schemes: SMS-based TAN solutions of four large banks, one instance of a visual TAN scheme, 2FA login verification systems of Google, Dropbox, Twitter and Facebook accounts, and the Google Authenticator app currently used by 32 third-party service providers. Finally, we cluster and analyze hundreds of real-world malicious Android apps that target mobile 2FA schemes and show that banking Trojans already deploy mobile counterparts that steal 2FA credentials like TANs.},

@inproceedings{sec_analysis_webauthn,
	Abstract = {Due to the success of formal modeling of protocols such as TLS, there is a revival of interest in applying formal modeling to standardized APIs. We argue that formal modeling should happen as the standard is being developed (not afterwards) as it can detect complex or even simple attacks that the standardization group may not otherwise detect. As a case example of this, we discuss in detail the W3C Web Cryptography API. We demonstrate how a formal analysis of the API using the modeling language AVISPA with a SAT solver demonstrates that while the API has no errors in basic API operations and maintains its security properties for the most part, there are nonetheless attacks on secret key material due to how key wrapping and usages are implemented. Furthermore, there were a number of basic problems in terms of algorithm selection and a weakness that led to a padding attack. The results of this study led to the removal of algorithms before its completed standardization and the removal of the padding attack via normalization of error codes, although the key wrapping attack is still open. We expect this sort of formal methodology to be applied to new standardization efforts at the W3C such as the W3C Web Authentication API.},
