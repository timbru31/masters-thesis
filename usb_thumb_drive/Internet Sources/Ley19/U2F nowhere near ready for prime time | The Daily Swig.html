                    <p class="standfirst">Anti-phishing tech is anything but universal</p><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/ac7c2dd3fa5b-article-u2f_authentication_main_header.jpg" title="PortSwigger Ltd"></p><p>The
 use of hardware security keys to secure online accounts against 
phishing is being heavily promoted by the industry, but tests by <span class="italic">The Daily Swig</span> have shown that the technology remains poorly supported by websites and browsers.</p><p>Even
 some consumer-focused services that support U2F-based authentication – 
such as Facebook and Twitter – fall back to supporting less secure app 
or SMS-based authentication in the absence of a hardware key, 
undermining most of the extra security protections the tech might 
otherwise offer.</p><p class="bold">Life, the Universe, and Authentication</p><p>U2F
 (Universal 2nd Factor) is an open authentication standard designed to 
strengthen two-factor authentication (2FA). The technology, managed by 
the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FIDO Alliance</a>, makes use of USB or near-field communication (NFC) technology, and is similar to that widely found in smart cards.</p><p>Two-factor authentication renders a password and login ID alone not enough to log into an online account. </p><p>The
 second factor typically comes in the form of a six-digit number sent by
 a service provider to a user’s pre-registered mobile phone, either via 
an SMS message or by an app.</p><p>After setup, a one-time 2FA code sent via SMS needs to be confirmed before access is granted.</p><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/ef3067e36a12-article-190206-yubikeys.jpg" title="Image: Yubico"></p><p class="bold">Fly in the ointment</p><p>The
 growing prevalence of SIM-swap scams has rendered this approach 
perilous. Using either an SMS message or automated phone call to receive
 a one-time code is less secure than using a mobile authentication app 
such as Google Authenticator or Authy to generate codes.</p><p><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2019/01/two-factor-authentication-defeated-spotlight-2fas-latest-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">More sophisticated approaches</a>
 to phishing that incorporate man-in-the-middle attacks can circumvent 
these protections through schemes geared towards tricking users into 
handing over their codes as well as their passwords.</p><p>Either 
approach – more accurately described as two-step rather than two-factor 
authentication – is much better than relying on a password alone, even 
though it’s far from bullet-proof.</p><p>The threat is far from academic. Various forms of malware-based attacks targeting 2FA have already been developed.</p><p>Hackers
 have even developed web-based attack tools to dumb down the process of 
circumventing 2FA, such as the recently uncovered <a href="https://www.grahamcluley.com/automated-phishing-attack-tool-bypasses-2fa-protection/" target="_blank">Modlishka utility</a>.</p><p>More
 secure forms of authentication involve “something that you know” 
alongside “something that you have” (a token) or “something that you 
are” (biometrics).</p><p>This is where U2F comes in.</p><p>Google <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">proudly states</a>
 that it has avoided a successful phishing attack against any of its 
workers since the mandatory introduction of U2F back in 2017.</p><p>The tech firm’s <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Advanced Protection Program</a>
 is also built on the foundation of U2F tech. The program is aimed at 
journalists, activists, and political campaign teams, but isn’t 
available for business-focused G Suite accounts.</p><p>Google is by far 
the only organization to promote U2F hardware key authentication tech. 
Last month, the Committee to Protect Journalists started&nbsp;<a href="https://cpj.org/2019/01/digital-safety-using-security-keys-to-secure-accou.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">actively encouraging reporters</a> to use security keys to access online accounts.</p><p>U2F hardware keys are hot right now. The devices cost from just $20, they clearly fulfill a need, and their promise is enticing.</p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/329d0997b686-article-14-select-your-yubikey.jpg"></p><p class="italic text-center">Select your YubiKey</p><br><p>Recently, <span class="italic">The Daily Swig</span>
 sourced samples of the tech. We obtained a YubiKey from Yubico – 
probably the best-known brand in the market – as well as U2F security 
keys from Nitrokey and start-up SoloKey.</p><p>We would have also liked to have gotten our hands on Google’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key/" target="_blank">Titan security key</a>, but these are not yet available in Europe, thwarting our ambitions in that direction.</p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/e12ba55deacb-article-2-solokeys.jpg" title="PortSwigger Ltd"></p><p class="italic text-center">SoloKeys and sheaths</p><br><p>We
 set off wanting to do a comparative review, but it quickly became 
apparent that, at this point, support for U2F technology among web 
services in general was a much bigger issue than the competitive 
features of different devices.</p><p>Accordingly, we decided to explore this technology, rather than writing a straight product review.</p><p>As the <a href="https://www.dongleauth.info/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dongleauth.info</a>
 tracker site notes, consumer-facing sites that support U2F include 
Twitter, Facebook, and Dropbox, as well as Google and its various 
properties (including, but not limited to, Gmail). The websites and web 
services of both Apple and Microsoft are yet to support U2F.</p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/57aeb3d97f1f-article-3-u2f-supported-sites.jpg" title="PortSwigger Ltd"></p><p class="italic text-center">U2F supported sites</p><br><p>In
 the financial services sector, an obvious arena for the application of 
U2F and the stronger authentication it promises, the picture is even 
more patchy.</p><p>For example, online payment technology Stripe 
supports U2F, but PayPal does not. PayPal is a particularly striking 
omission since it’s a member of the FIDO2 Project alliance. Likewise, 
eBay’s adoption has yet to materialize.</p><p>U2F is a technology well 
suited to the requirement of enterprise-focused services. GitLab and 
BitBucket support its use by software developers, the main users of both
 services.</p><p>Support for U2F is also found in Amazon Web Services, if not on the e-commerce side of Amazon’s business.</p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/ffef6210ff64-article-4-linkedin-1.png" title="PortSwigger Ltd"></p><p class="italic text-center">LinkedIn only supports two-step verification</p><br><p>If
 there’s one area where you’d expect U2F technology to be encouraged, 
it’s among password managers. Here again, though, matters are lacking.<br></p><p><span>LastPass</span> endorses U2F, but only in the premium version of its product.</p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/c8f1c8610939-article-5-lastpass-premium.png" title="PortSwigger Ltd"></p><p class="italic text-center">LastPass only supports U2F with the premium version of its service</p><br><p>It’s a <a href="https://twitter.com/DashlaneSupport/status/1082378840746479626" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">similar story</a> with <span>Dashlane</span>. We found adding a security key to a Windows installation of the Dashlane app to be a cumbersome process.</p><p>Another major player, <span>1Password</span>, only supports YubiKey for <a href="https://twitter.com/1Password/status/1080608656662675456" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hardware key-based authentication</a>.</p><p class="bold">Four-squared</p><p>With
 a limited list of (consumer-focused) targets, we decided to focus on 
signing up to use U2F for Google (Gmail), social media (Twitter and 
Facebook), and Dropbox accounts. We used a Chromebook and Windows 7 
machine in our testing.</p><p>Phase one of enrolment generally involves 
associating an account with a mobile phone and sending a code via text 
to confirm it. Users can then switch to the more convenient route of 
receiving their codes through an app.</p><p>Our testing failed to 
uncover any example of jumping straight to using U2F hardware keys 
without preliminaries – you had to enroll for SMS or app-based 
authentication first.</p><p>During the process of adding a hardware key,
 you’ll be asked to log back into an account. It’s a good idea to sign 
up with a backup key at the same time, just in case you lose your main 
one.</p><p>One of these keys should be NFC compatible so that it works 
with your smartphone. If you lose one of your keys you can use the other
 to login, un-enroll the lost key, and sign up with a new one.</p><p>If 
you’re unfortunate enough to somehow lose both your hardware keys, then 
you’ll be locked out of your account. That’s why it’s a good idea to a 
set of emergency access backup codes, which you’re able to either store 
digitally or print – either way, keep them in a safe place.</p><p>Backup codes aren’t an option for Google Advanced Protection, which has a more stringent account recovery regime.</p><p>The
 enrollment process for various sites is multi-stage, but not especially
 difficult. In the case of Google, once you jump through a few hoops (as
 explained in some depth in a <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/beyond-passwords-2fa-u2f-and-google-advanced-protection/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> by Troy Hunt), you’ll be able to login with security keys as default.</p><p>Google’s
 multi-stage process is quite well designed, and this might be partly 
because its web services align naturally with its Chrome browser.</p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/a815b9220dd9-article-6-gmail-security-key-added.jpg" title="PortSwigger Ltd"></p><p class="italic text-center">Gmail login with hardware security key enabled</p><br><p>In
 the case of Facebook, by contrast, hardware security keys are only 
supported as backup. Users cannot establish the security key as the 
default option, even after you’ve enrolled a device.</p><p>We found that
 if you attempted to remove verification via an authenticator app, or 
dissociate an account from a mobile phone number, then the system would 
disable 2FA as a whole and you’d be back to square one.</p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/dbf98ff4bd6b-article-7-facebook-security-key.jpg" title="PortSwigger Ltd"></p><p class="italic text-center">Adding a security key to Facebook</p><br><p>Facebook explains that this is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/security-key-for-safer-logins-with-a-touch/10154125089265766/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">deliberate design choice</a>, prompted by what it describes as a lack of support for U2F within some browsers and by some (unnamed) mobile devices.</p><p>“Security
 keys for Facebook logins currently only work with certain web browsers 
and mobile devices, so we’ll ask you to also register an additional 
login approval method, such as your mobile phone or Code Generator,” the
 company said.</p><p>U2F vendor Nitrokey has acknowledged this browser compatibility problem in its <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/documentation/installation#p:nitrokey-fido-u2f&amp;os:windows" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">setup documentation</a>.</p><p>Twitter,
 which introduced U2F compatibility last June, doesn’t let you select 
hardware-based security keys as the default authentication option, 
either. </p><p>If you disable both the mobile security app and 
Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) options, then you disable login 
verification. Establishing hardware security keys as the default option 
isn’t possible, according to our tests.</p><p>Twitter itself confirms this, again telling users they need to have a <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication#security-key" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">phone number associated with your account</a> for ‘account recovery’.</p> Keys alone aren’t an option.<p></p><p></p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/c596e61cb4e5-article-8-twitter-2fa-setup.jpg" title="PortSwigger Ltd"></p><p class="italic text-center">Twitter account with hardware security key authentication enabled</p><br><p>It’s
 the same story with Dropbox. You have to have an alternate second 
factor system set up first before adding a hardware key as an additional
 authentication option. Even when you add a hardware security key, your 
U2F device can only be set up as a backup and not enforced as the 
default option.</p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/3d96309160e8-article-9-dropbox.jpg" title="PortSwigger Ltd" width="600"></p><p class="italic text-center">Dropbox security key added</p><br><p>In
 the case of Gmail, our tests found that if you’ve only enrolled with 
one U2F hardware key, and that hardware wasn’t present on a system, the 
process would fall back to accepting codes from an app.</p><p>This happens even when using a PC that hadn’t been previously used to log in.</p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/6b6fcfc0cb15-article-10-google-2fa-setup.png" title="PortSwigger Ltd"></p><p class="italic text-center">YubiKey selected as the default option on a Gmail account, but other options can’t be disallowed</p><br><p>The
 above U2F fallback mechanisms partially frustrate the purpose of using 
stronger hardware-based authentication. We say partially because there 
are still some ancillary benefits.</p><p>If you associate a hardware key
 with an online account, then you avoid the hassle of having to manually
 enter an authentication code yourself, while the hardware token 
provides cryptographic proof to a web service that it’s in your machine.</p><p>You’d
 simply tap a small hardware device that goes in the USB drive of your 
computer – less hassle than using a code generated via an app or (yet 
more trouble) an SMS message.</p><p>This falls short of ensuring your 
login is immune to phishing because of backward support for less 
sophisticated authentication schemes, as with Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Google
 Advanced Protection, however, goes the extra mile to lock down 
accounts. Once an account is enrolled, using a hardware security key is 
mandated, as our tests confirmed. </p><p>This approach defends against 
man-in-the middle phishing attacks designed to capture both login 
details and authentication codes, Google <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/" target="_blank">explains</a>.</p><p>Additional
 security measures in Advanced Protection mean only Google and select 
third-party apps retain the ability to access an enrolled user’s emails 
and Drive files – an inconvenience for some, if not many.</p><br><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/c1a9fe3c39e9-article-190205-google-fallback-1.jpg" title="PortSwigger Ltd"></p><p class="italic text-center">Google’s Advanced Protection does not offer a fallback to weaker SMS authentication</p><br><p class="bold">Two-step</p><p>In
 conclusion, we found that multi-factor authentication (2FA, but more 
accurately described) through a mobile app is much easier to set up, and
 more widely supported than hardware token-based U2F.</p><p>Consumer-focused
 web-services – with the important exception of Google’s Advanced 
Protection program – only support hardware token-based authentication as
 a backup, limiting the utility of the technology as things stand.</p><p>This assessment isn’t far out of line with what other experts have found.</p><p>“Password
 and soft token is probably the best balance of security, usability and 
cost we have going for us today,” Hunt notes in his <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/beyond-passwords-2fa-u2f-and-google-advanced-protection/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on U2F and Google Advanced Protection.</p><p>While
 Google’s Advanced Protection scheme works, it isn’t really ready for 
mainstream use. This is disappointing given U2F technology is needed, 
especially at a time when attacks against 2FA are growing in 
sophistication.</p><p>Hacker Luke Berner, for example, recently <a href="https://medium.com/@lukeberner/how-i-abused-2fa-to-maintain-persistence-after-a-password-change-google-microsoft-instagram-7e3f455b71a1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">demonstrated</a> how he was able to abuse app-based 2FA to maintain persistence even after a password change.</p><p>Google, Microsoft, and Instagram accounts were all potentially vulnerable, Berner discovered.</p><p class="text-center"><img src="U2F%20nowhere%20near%20ready%20for%20prime%20time%20|%20The%20Daily%20Swig_files/7a03b5005941-article-190206-yubikey-1.jpg" title="Image: Yubico"></p><p class="bold">Back to the U2Future</p><p>Suppliers
 of U2F-compatible tokens admit that the utility of their technology is 
limited by partial or yet-to-arrive support by websites.</p><p>Despite this, they are still hopeful that change is in the air.</p><p>“U2F support is very disappointing,” Nicolas Stalder of SoloKeys told <span class="italic">The Daily Swig</span>. “The hope is that with FIDO2… approaching a standard, this will improve.”</p><p>U2F over NFC is even less supported than U2F on desktop or laptop, Stalder observed.</p><p>“U2F should be dead simple, for some reason it is shrouded in mystery, or at least obscurity to the wider audience,” he added.</p><p>Usability
 studies sponsored by Yubico provide further evidence that consumers 
find enrolling a U2F key and associating it with their account 
problematic.</p><p>Different web services also have broadly similar, but inconsistent enrollment schemes, tests by <span class="italic">The Daily Swig</span> found.</p><p>This
 may be a reason for the mediocre usability of what is otherwise a 
promising and useful technology, one that fulfills a growing need to 
fend off phishing – a form of attack that is growing in impact, 
according to a Google-sponsored study and <a href="https://blackhat.com/html/webcast/11292018-two-factor-authentication-usable-or-not.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">other sources</a>.</p><p>Stalder offered <span class="italic">The Daily Swig</span> a prescription to ease these woes.</p><span class="stylised-indent">U2F would be so easy if sites supported things properly:<br><br>•&nbsp;Have a visible invitation to register keys (instead of hiding behind multiple submenus)<br>•&nbsp;Suggest that users register at least two, or better, three keys<br>•&nbsp;Offer ‘one-time use codes’ as a backup, advising users to print them out and store them in a safe place<br>•&nbsp;If
 a [hardware security] key gets lost, a thief is probably not going to 
be able to use it immediately (either does not know the username, or has
 to crack password), so upon noticing this the user just logs in with a 
backup key and removes the stolen key from the whitelist/registered list<br></span><p>Part
 of the problem is that sites don’t want to handle out-of-band 
verification of ownership to re-enable login of users in cases where 
problems occur, according to Stalder.</p><p>“I think the reason why 
sites often don’t allow ‘U2F only’ is that it’s actually secure – if a 
user loses [all] the key[s], they won't get in! Or as some say, if they 
still can get in, it was all a ‘security theatre’,” he said</p><p>We asked the FIDO Alliance, as backers of the technology, to comment on our findings.</p><p>Chief
 marketing officer Andrew Shikiar declined to comment on specific 
implementations of U2F, although he did offer an explanation of how the 
FIDO2 specification will move authentication technology forward, 
ultimately leading onto more widespread adoption of stronger login 
security technology.</p><p>“FIDO2 includes the W3C Web Authentication 
API (Webauthn) and CTAP (Client-to-Authenticator Protocols) from 
the&nbsp;FIDO&nbsp;Alliance,” Shikiar explained.</p><p>“The specs 
enable&nbsp;FIDO&nbsp;Authentication support to be built directly into 
browsers and platforms, and will greatly expand the addressable market 
for&nbsp;FIDO&nbsp;as these browsers and operating systems push out 
updates to billions of devices.”</p><p>In developing FIDO2, the 
FIDO&nbsp;Alliance partnered with the World Wide Web Consortium on how 
to standardize&nbsp;FIDO&nbsp;across the web. The collaboration is 
designed to expand the addressable user base, as well as the available 
authentication use cases.</p><p>“The specs were <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-and-w3c-achieve-major-standards-milestone-in-global-effort-towards-simpler-stronger-authentication-on-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announced</a>
 only nine months ago, and&nbsp;FIDO2 technologies are already built 
into the latest versions of Windows 10, Google Play Services on Android,
 and the Chrome, Firefox, and Edge web browsers,” said Shikiar.</p><p>“WebKit,
 the technology behind Apple’s Safari web browser, is also previewing 
support for FIDO2. Native support across browsers and platforms 
eliminates a lot of the complexity of building strong authentication 
into apps, so we do believe it will lead to broad FIDO adoption.”&nbsp;</p><p>Greater
 usability for U2F is certainly desirable, but even that may not be 
enough to ensure widespread uptake –early last year, seven years after 
Google introduced less stringent 2FA, a Google engineer <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/17/no_one_uses_two_factor_authentication/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">admitted</a> that take-up was still under 10%.</p>
