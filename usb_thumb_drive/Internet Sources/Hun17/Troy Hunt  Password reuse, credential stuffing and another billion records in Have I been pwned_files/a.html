Keepass supports composite logins using keyfiles. This way you can create a keyfile, combine this with your password. The keyfile you only handle locally, and only put on devices that you trust, i.e. your home computer(s), your work computer, mobile phone, whatever you like. Then use whatever cloud service you like to sync the actual database. The point is that unless you have access to the keyfile this database is going to be ridiculously hard to crack, even if you can figure out the password. Another alternative is a USB stick with a portable version of KeePass. Just remember to keep a backup copy of it at home :-)\u003c/p>\u003cp>3) Not going to happen. But you don't necessarily have to do them all at once. You just need to start somewhere. Even if you start using a pw manager and then start changing (and recording) new pws for the most critical sites and services, you are on your way.

 I tend to use emails of the form: domain.reversed@rangat.org, though 
older accounts got things like 'irl-&lt;dom&gt;@rangat.org' or 
'web-&lt;dom&gt;@rangat.org'<br>I got an alert mail from you for the 
latest and it looks like my O'Reilly media address is now in the dumps. 
I'd noticed that I started getting spam there awhile back and fired off 
an email to a former coworker who went to work there. He was going to 
investigate, but hasn't gotten back to me.<br>Anyway, just to let you know that '@rangat.org' email addresses can be used as a semi-reliable indicator of who got hacked.</p></div></div><span

 did see the edit, and I'm not asking for the whole password.  Before I 
started using a password manager, I used a password system for many 
years to keep passwords distinct across sites, and the last two 
characters (or the two before that, if the last two are numeric) are 
enough to inform me if it's from one of the breaches already in HIBP 
(and which one, since there was only 3 or 4 that I was in), or from a 
new breach elsewhere.  It'll also let me narrow down where I need to 
update my password to a new managed one, if I haven't done that already.</p><p>If you're particularly paranoid, you could authenticate me through a third party, a mutual colleague of ours.  :-)</p><p>For
 what it's worth, I suspect a vBulletin breach that you loaded last 
year, because it used MD5 hashes, but I also know of a phone service 
provider that had the audacity to email me my password in plain text.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-1" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">1</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a class="comment-footer__action" href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook"></button></li><li class="link"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/1ifhysa" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/1ifhysa"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:3291205978"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-3291208800"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="3291208800"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/troyhunt/" data-action="profile" data-username="troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="6561505" src="a_data/noavatar92_002.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/troyhunt/" data-action="profile" data-username="troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troy Hunt</a></span> <span class="badge moderator">Mod</span></span><span> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned/#comment-3291205978" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> Mike Cattle</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned/#comment-3291208800" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Saturday, May 6, 2017 4:29 AM">2 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I

 time I read your comment about password managers I feel like I want to 
make that change. What you say about them makes sense. My problems with 
it are:</p><p>1) I want an offline version of a password manager. I do 
not want to store anything in the cloud particularly when it comes to 
cloud stuff. eg Keepass....<br>2) At the same time, I want to be able to
 use my passwords on multiple different computers. Yes I know some of 
them allow you to copy the password database from machine to machine. 
That is fine for home use.<br>3) It would be nice if said password 
manager could go through my accounts and change them for me - not 
possible unless I use a cloud password manager.<br>4) I must admit to 
being scared of the idea that if they get into the local database and 
get the master password, they have access to all my passwords. I don't 
know how possible that is in terms of a remote attack. I guess its got 
to be harder than cracking a web browser which stores your passwords.<br>5)
 The final problem for me, is say if I am at work and want to login 
somewhere, there is no way in hell that I will be able to remember said 
password.</p><p>If anyone has some thoughts/ideas how to overcome that, please feel free to chime in. <br>I
 know it makes total sense to do it, its just these niggles that bother 
me. It feels like it will be hours of me logging into websites and using
 the password manager to change them and all I can think is that I have 
never had a password breach (yet touchwood). Which is a silly thought. A
 stupid one.</p><p>I don't know if anyone else thinks like this. Maybe I
 am the only idiotic person who reads Troy's blog but does not use a 
password manager, despite reading time and time again about data 
breaches.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-1" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">1</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a class="comment-footer__action" href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook"></button></li><li class="link"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/1iemfd8" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/1iemfd8"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:3289734476"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-3289745648"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="3289745648"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/troyhunt/" data-action="profile" data-username="troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="6561505" src="a_data/noavatar92_002.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/troyhunt/" data-action="profile" data-username="troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troy Hunt</a></span> <span class="badge moderator">Mod</span></span><span> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned/#comment-3289734476" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> chump2010</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned/#comment-3289745648" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Friday, May 5, 2017 9:18 AM">2 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>This is worth reading: <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.troyhunt.com%2Fpassword-managers-dont-have-to-be-perfect-they-just-have-to-be-better-than-not-having-one%2F%3AM4DWkQD57eyHYPLwm0C5Z9MewBs&amp;cuid=621325" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-managers-dont-have-to-be-perfect-they-just-have-to-be-better-than-not-having-one/">https://www.troyhunt.com/pa...</a></p><p>I

obtainable, that should Mert your needs.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-1" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">1</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a class="comment-footer__action" href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook"></button></li><li class="link"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/1iemnzk" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/1iemnzk"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:3289745648"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-3289745648-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li><li class="post" id="post-3291377318"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="3291377318"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_hoU8zY2Zr8/" data-action="profile" data-username="disqus_hoU8zY2Zr8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="144818306" src="a_data/noavatar92_002.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_hoU8zY2Zr8/" data-action="profile" data-username="disqus_hoU8zY2Zr8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned/#comment-3289734476" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> chump2010</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned/#comment-3291377318" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Saturday, May 6, 2017 9:22 AM">2 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I

 Keepass. Keepass supports composite logins using keyfiles. This way you
 can create a keyfile, combine this with your password. The keyfile you 
only handle locally, and only put on devices that you trust, i.e. your 
home computer(s), your work computer, mobile phone, whatever you like. 
Then use whatever cloud service you like to sync the actual database. 
The point is that unless you have access to the keyfile this database is
 going to be ridiculously hard to crack, even if you can figure out the 
password. Another alternative is a USB stick with a portable version of 
KeePass. Just remember to keep a backup copy of it at home :-)</p><p>3) 
Not going to happen. But you don't necessarily have to do them all at 
once. You just need to start somewhere. Even if you start using a pw 
manager and then start changing (and recording) new pws for the most 
critical sites and services, you are on your way. Then just take the 
rest as you go along.</p><p>4) If somebody gets your db, you're screwed.
 But the alternative, using a single pw everywhere and having it leaked 
also leaves you with your pants on your ankles. And having some site 
leak users/pws is way more likely than you leaking your db.</p><p>5) That is why you use password managers.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-0" data-action="upvote" title="Vote up" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">0</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a class="comment-footer__action" href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook"></button></li><li class="link"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/1ien44t" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/1ien44t"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:3289766573"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-3289766573-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li><li class="post" id="post-3289751589"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="3289751589"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_lidVU20Usu/" data-action="profile" data-username="disqus_lidVU20Usu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="230778838" src="a_data/noavatar92_002.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_lidVU20Usu/" data-action="profile" data-username="disqus_lidVU20Usu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenneth Lim</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned/#comment-3289734476" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> chump2010</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned/#comment-3289751589" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Friday, May 5, 2017 9:27 AM">2 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I
 had the same concern as you as well and had even went as far as looking
 to build alternatives myself (not rolling my own crypto, that would be 
insane, just looking for p2p keepass syncing so I don't need cloud) but 
in the end, because I use only Apple products in all my workflow, I just
 use icloud keychain with the option to not store the keychain in 
icloud. It does what I want, a password manager that sync passwords to 
all my devices and not store them in the cloud.</p><p>Although to be 
honest, to a certain extend, I'm now not worried about my password 
database being leaked. I can copy someone my password database and 
chances are they won't be able to get any of my password for at least 
another 10-20 years if not billions of years worth of computing power 
(depending on luck and skill). So use one, even if it means storing it 
in the cloud. Also I got used to not logging into computers I don't 
own/control, if you need your password for work, just set up your 
password manager on your work place or look it up on say your phone.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-0" data-action="upvote" title="Vote up" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">0</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a class="comment-footer__action" href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook"></button></li><li class="link"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/1iemskl" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/1iemskl"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:3289751589"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-3289751589-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li></ul><div class="show-children-wrapper hidden"><a class="show-children" id="post-3289734476-show-children" data-action="show-children" href="#">Show more replies</a></div></div></li><li class="post" id="post-3289691899"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="3289691899"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar"><div class="user"><img src="a_data/noavatar92_002.png" class="user" alt="Avatar"></div></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span class="author">Dave Payne</span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned/#comment-3289691899" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Friday, May 5, 2017 7:58 AM">2 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Thanks
 Troy - not sure if you're keeping a list, but just in case - an address
 at my domain was in this breach, and I'm confident it was only used on 
AndroidForums, and was already reported in that breach on HIBP.</p><p>One
 thought, which I'm sure will have occurred to you - and is probably 
more work than its worth - but for identifying the source, might it be 
helpful to look at the email addresses found for subscribers to the 
domain search service? For example, the reason I'm sure this address was
 only used at AndroidForums is that it was 
androidforums@&lt;my-domain&gt;. I assume I'm not the only one who uses a
