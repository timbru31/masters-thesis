Though on the surface all seems calm, below the waves the social network is kicking its legs frantically and working around the clock to keep users' accounts safe.Keeping Facebook safe and keeping it secure are two different things, the social network's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, said Wednesday at Web Summit in Lisbon. Security is about building walls to keep out threats and shore up defenses, but according to Stamos, safety is bigger than that.\"It turns out that we can build perfectly secure software and yet people can still get hurt,\" he said. Stamos came to Facebook in summer 2015 from Yahoo and now leads a team at the social network that tries to get ahead of hackers and other threats and head off trouble before it strikes. The biggest headache he deals with is caused by the humble password.\"The reuse of passwords is the No. 1 cause of harm on the internet,\" said the security chief.When passwords are stolen en masse and traded on the black market, it becomes apparent just how many of them are the same -- \"123456\" and its consecutive numerical brethren are the main culprits. If you're using one of these passwords, that automatically makes your account more vulnerable to being compromised. This is something Facebook is keen to help you avoid.To check that Facebook members are not choosing these commonly used passwords for their accounts, Stamos revealed, the social network buys passwords hackers are selling on the black market and cross-references them with encrypted passwords used on the site. He described the task as \"computationally heavy\" but said that as a result of the exercise Facebook has been able to alert tens of millions of users that their passwords needed changing because they weren't strong enough.Facebook provides a whole bunch of tools for users to make the security on an account nice and tight, ranging from traditional two-factor authentication to identifying faces of friends. But for Stamos, this is only part of the solution when it comes to keeping people safe.\"Even though we provide these options, it is our responsibility to think about those people that choose not to use them,\" he said.One way the company does this is to apply machine learning algorithms to Facebook's social graph to establish whether activity on your account is fraudulent. Another concept currently in the works tackles the problem of account recovery. If hackers find their way into your email, it's easy for them to seize your Facebook account too, by choosing the password reset option. Instead, Facebook wants people to allow their close friends to verify an account-recovery request on their behalf.\"Usernames and passwords are an idea that came out of 1970s mainframe architectures,\" said Stamos. \"They were not built for 2016.\" ","speakable":{"@type":"SpeakableSpecification","cssSelector":[".speakableText",".article-dek",".speakableTextP1",".speakableTextP2"]}}</script>

Though on the surface all seems calm, below the waves the social network is kicking its legs frantically and working around the clock to keep users' accounts safe.</p><p>Keeping Facebook safe and keeping it secure are two different things, the social network's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, said Wednesday at Web Summit in Lisbon. Security is about building walls to keep out threats and shore up defenses, but according to Stamos, safety is bigger than that.</p><p>"It turns out that we can build perfectly secure software and yet people can still get hurt," he said. </p><p>Stamos came to Facebook <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-nabs-yahoos-chief-information-security-officer/">in summer 2015 from Yahoo</a> and now leads a team at the social network that tries to get ahead of hackers and other threats and head off trouble before it strikes. The biggest headache he deals with is caused by the humble password.</p><p>"The <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/reusing-passwords-is-riskier-than-ever-botnet-cyber-attacks-security/" target="_blank" data-component="externalLink" rel="noopener">reuse of passwords</a> is the No. 1 cause of harm on the internet," said the security chief.</p><p>When passwords are stolen en masse and traded on the black market, it becomes apparent just how many of them are the same -- "123456" and its consecutive numerical brethren are the main culprits. If you're using one of these <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/passage-the-worst-computer-passwords/" target="_blank" data-component="externalLink" rel="noopener">passwords</a>, that automatically makes your account more vulnerable to being compromised. This is something Facebook is keen to help you avoid.</p><p>To check that Facebook members are not choosing these commonly used passwords for their accounts, Stamos revealed, the social network buys passwords hackers are selling on the black market and cross-references them with encrypted passwords used on the site. He described the task as "computationally heavy" but said that as a result of the exercise Facebook has been able to alert tens of millions of users that their passwords needed changing because they weren't strong enough.</p><p>Facebook provides a whole bunch of tools for users <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/secure-your-facebook-account-in-six-easy-steps/">to make the security on an account nice and tight</a>, ranging from traditional two-factor authentication to identifying faces of friends. But for Stamos, this is only part of the solution when it comes to keeping people safe.</p><p>"Even though we provide these options, it is our responsibility to think about those people that choose not to use them," he said.</p><p>One way the company does this is to apply machine learning algorithms to Facebook's social graph to establish whether activity on your account is fraudulent. Another concept currently in the works tackles the problem of account recovery. If hackers find their way into your email, it's easy for them to seize your Facebook account too, by choosing the password reset option. Instead, Facebook wants people to allow their close friends to verify an account-recovery request on their behalf.</p><p>"Usernames and passwords are an idea that came out of 1970s mainframe architectures," said Stamos. "They were not built for 2016." </p>

Alas, they cost $400, but they're great for blocking out the world while studying.</p>

    <p>Sony's WH-1000XM3, the third generation of Sony's excellent wireless  noise-canceling headphones, is more comfortable and features even better  performance. It's currently our top-rated noise-canceling headphone, edging out the Bose models on some key points.</p>

    <p>While its  noise-canceling feature and comfort levels aren't quite on par with  competing models from Bose and Sony, JBL's Live 650BTNC ($160) measures up well in terms of sound. It's  worth considering if you don't want to spend $300 or more on a  noise-canceling headphone.</p>

    <p>While they aren't water-resistant, Sony's new WF-1000XM3 true wireless earphones feature excellent sound and something you won't find in Apple's AirPods: active noise-cancelling. At $230, they're not cheap, but they are among the best new true wireless earphones of 2019.</p>

    <p>The Powerbeats Pro, Beats' first true wireless earphones, are larger, sportier versions of the 2019 AirPods. They offer all the same basic conveniences  of the AirPods, including fast pairing, rock-solid wireless  connectivity and always-on Siri voice recognition for iOS users, but they deliver bigger sound and have better battery life. Only drawbacks: They're fairly pricey and have a bulky charging case.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Apple's second-generation AirPods are an incremental upgrade from the original AirPods -- and incremental upgrades tend to be a little boring. And on the  surface anyway, the new AirPods aren't exciting. Thanks to  those updated components on the inside, however, including a new H1 chip that  supports Bluetooth 5.0, improved audio synchronization and always-on <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tags/siri/">Siri</a>, they're definitely better in small ways that a lot of people will appreciate. Even though it's about $40 more, the model with the wireless charging case is probably the one to get -- if you're giving it as a gift anyway. (Since midsummer, the AirPods have been reduced by $15-$20 at many retailers online: Don't pay more than $145 for the regular models or $180 for the wireless charging model.)</p>

    <p>Jabra's Elite Active 65t ($190) are one of the top truly wireless earphones and  are superior to Apple's AirPods in some ways. The step-down Elite 65t  earphones aren't quite as durable, but there isn't a huge difference and they sometimes go on sale. Just be aware that both models have been on the market for a while and are due for an upgrade. In other words, don't buy them at full price.</p>

    <p>Geared toward runners and bikers,&nbsp;<a href="https://aftershokz.com/" target="_blank">AfterShokz</a>&nbsp;bone-conduction headphones get a little better with each new generation. New for 2019 is the Aeropex ($160), which AfterShokz says are its "lightest, highest-quality headphones yet."</p><p>The technology can be a good match for people with partial hearing loss. The other big benefit is that thanks to the headphone's open design, you can hear what's going on around you while listening to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/topics/music/">music</a>&nbsp;or having a phone conversation through the headphone. That openness allows runners and bikers to hear traffic, an important safety feature. Also, some race coordinators don't allow you to wear anything in your ears, which is where a headphone like the Aeropex comes in handy, particularly for people who need to listen to music while they run. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>Here's a way to combine two gifts into one. Yes, the Bose Frames ($200) are both sunglasses and headphones -- and they sound surprisingly good for sunglasses.</p><p>The Frames are available in two models: the Rondo and Alto. You can only get them in black for now.</p>

    <p>It's a little expensive at $300, but the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless is currently the best-sounding true wireless headphone.</p>

    <p>If you don't want to spend a lot on a headphone gift but want something that sounds good and is comfortable to wear, the Tribit XFree Tune at $40 is a good bet for a full-size Bluetooth headphone. It doesn't have active noise-canceling but the earcups passively seal out a fair amount of sound.</p>
