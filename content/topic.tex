\end{large}

The purpose of this master's thesis is an introduction to multi-factor authentication, as well as to the conventional methods of authentication (knowledge, possession, biometrics). This introduction includes technical functionality, web usability, and potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

Further, this thesis will investigate whether the Web Authentication API is suitable as an alternative or possible supplement to existing multi-factor authentication methods. The question has to be answered to what extent the Web Authentication API can increase security and user comfort. An evaluation of the security of the Web Authentication API in comparison with other multi-factor authentication solutions plays a crucial role in this thesis.
