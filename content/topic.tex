\end{large}

The purpose of this master's thesis is an introduction to multi-factor authentication, as well as to the conventional methods of authentication (knowledge, possession, biometrics) including their technical functionality, web usability, and potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

The thesis will investigate whether the Web Authentication API is suitable as an alternative or possible supplement to existing multi-factor authentication methods. The question has to be answered to what extent the Web Authentication API can increase security and user comfort. The evaluation of the security of the Web Authentication API in comparison with other multi-factor authentication solutions plays a crucial role in this thesis.
