\section{Smart Cards}

Smart cards, sometimes called chip cards or \glspl{icc}, too, are physical plastic cards, often the size of a credit card. They contain an internal chip for user authentication. The chip is either exposed or can be accessed contactless. Typical examples are \gls{sim} cards, credit cards, \glspl{cac} used by the \gls{us} Department of Defense, or identity cards issued by authorities. In \gls{it}, smart cards can also store certificates and are used for computer log on. The smart card differs from a regular storage card by having a microprocessor and an \gls{eprom} or \gls{eeprom}. It is defined in the \gls{iso} standard 7816, which also defines different sizes of smart cards. The \gls{nist} standard \gls{fips} 201-2 defines the usage of smart cards for \gls{piv} for federal employees.\footcites[See][525--527]{eckert-it-sec-9}[See][]{iso7816}[See][6--9]{Mayes2017}[See][]{FIPS201-2}

\autoref{fig:smartcard_arch} on the next page shows the typical architecture of a smart card chip. The \gls{rom} contains the \gls{os} of the smart card, whereas the \gls{ram} is used for temporary storage. The application storage uses the \gls{eeprom}. Some smart cards also contain a second processor (co-processor) for cryptographic operations.

Security-wise an essential requirement is that an attacker cannot access the private data on the internal chip, i.e., that the smart card is tamper-resistant. This is, e.g., achieved by physically covering the \gls{cpu}, \gls{ram}, and \gls{eeprom} with a shield. The data stored on the smart card can itself protected by using a \gls{pin} or biometrics, such as a fingerprint, to access the data.\footcites[See][34]{265831}[See][228]{Tunstall2017}

In the aspect of usability, the smart card always requires dedicated hardware, either external or built-in. A smart card reader is necessary to use the smart card as an authentication method. While especially enterprise notebooks contain a smart card slot, e.g., mobile phones do not. The \gls{ccid} protocol defines a \gls{usb} protocol, so it is at least possible to use a \gls{usb} card reader. Additionally, smart cards with an embedded \gls{jcvm} allow the execution of Java application and servlets, further opening the development possibilities for smart card applications.\footcites[See][65]{Markantonakis2017}[See][539]{eckert-it-sec-9}
