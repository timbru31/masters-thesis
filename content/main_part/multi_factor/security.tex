\chapter{Security of Multi-Factor Authentication}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter analyses the introduced \gls{mfa} solutions in regards of their security aspects, ranging from algorithms and transportation threats, past vulnerabilities to implementation pitfalls.

\autoref{fig:2fa_flow_phishing} shows the already in \autoref{fig:2fa_flow} explained \gls{mfa} flow using a \gls{totp}. In this figure the scenario is expanded with a phishing attack. The user visits a phishing copy of the website they want to use and do not recognize this. Because he knows that this site is using \gls{mfa} they provide the \gls{totp} to the phishing site, too. This allows the interceptor to steal both the password (knowledge; first factor) and \gls{totp} (possession; second factor) to successfully login to the victims account and effectively bypassing the \gls{mfa} solution.

\section{One-Time Passwords}
\label{sec:totp_sec}

In this section the security of both \gls{hotp} and \gls{totp} are being analyzed.
