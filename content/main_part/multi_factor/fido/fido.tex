\section{FIDO's Universal Authentication Framework}
\subsection{FIDO Alliance}
\label{subsec:fido_alliance}

The \gls{fido} alliance is an open industry association founded in July 2012 that launched publicly in February 2013. Companies such as PayPal, Lenovo, and Infineon founded the \gls{fido} alliance. Currently the alliance has more than 260 members, including, e.g., Google, Amazon, Yubico, Samsung, Microsoft, VISA, or MasterCard. The goal of the \gls{fido} alliance is to develop new authentication protocols and standards in order to enhance and simplify the user experience of \gls{mfa} and to reduce the supersaturated usage of passwords. The \gls{fido} alliance developed the specifications \gls{uaf} and \gls{u2f}.\footcites[See][]{fido-history}[See][583]{eckert-it-sec-9}[See][17]{fido-ct-2}

Another goal of the \gls{fido} alliance is the user privacy. As all specifications are based on public-key cryptography, this goal is easily achieved as each key-pair is unique for every registration the user performs and not shared with third parties. Because of the public-key cryptography, no link between the same user on different websites exist. Further, a \gls{rp} is only allowed to access the public-key credentials that are associated with the origin of the \gls{rp}. In addition, one of the core principles is that biometric data never leaves the local authenticator and that no action is performed without the users consent. Besides that, no authenticator device is uniquely identifiable, but only on a manufacturer or production-batch level.\footcite[See][6--7]{fido-privacy}
