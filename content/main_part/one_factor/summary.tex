\section{Summary}

This chapter established the basis of authentication, most importantly the different methods of authentication. These include the knowledge, often being passwords, the possession of, e.g., security tokens and the secret to generate an \gls{otp}. Further, biometrics are of importance for the remainder of this thesis.

In addition, the concepts of attestation, i.e., proving or vouching for an entity and the challenge-response authentication have been introduced. This concept is of concern for the \gls{u2f} and \wa. Moreover, the \gls{fido} alliance with the first building block, the \gls{uaf} has been explained.

Building upon these conceptions of single-factor authentication, the next chapter analyses their security in more depth, while \autoref{chap:mfa} describes the combination of different authentication methods to achieve a \gls{mfa}.
