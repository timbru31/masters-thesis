The problems that are transferred to the \wa{} are the ones of authentication by possession already described in chapter xx. If the \wa{} is used with a security key then the same riss of damage, loss or theft exist. Besides that if the security key itself is not protected (by e.g. fingerprints) an attacker can easily gain access to an account if he steals or copies the authenticator.
