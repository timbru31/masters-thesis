\section{History and evolution}

The \wa{} is an outcome of joint efforts from the \gls{fido} alliance and and the \gls{w3c}. It is a product from various preceding industry standards, namely \gls{uaf} and \gls{u2f}. This chapter introduces the origin of the \wa{} by explaining the origin of the \gls{fido} alliance and their works on the \gls{uaf} and \gls{u2f} with a focus of the technical implementations, protocols and used techniques.

\subsection{FIDO Alliance}

The \gls{fido} alliance is an open industry association founded in July 2012 and launched in February 2013. Companies such as PayPal, Lenovo, and Infineon founded the \gls{fido} alliance. Currently the alliance has more than 260 members, including, e.g., Google, Amazon, Yubico, Samsung, Microsoft, VISA, or MasterCard. The goal of the \gls{fido} alliance is to develop new authentication protocols and standards in order to enhance and simplify the user experience of \gls{mfa} and to reduce the over usage of passwords.\footcites[See][583]{eckert-it-sec-9}

The \gls{fido} alliance developed the specifications \gls{uaf} and \gls{u2f}. The first specification of the \gls{u2f} was the starting point for the development of the \wa{} in a joint efforts with the \gls{w3c}. The \gls{ctap} is based on the \gls{u2f} specification 1.2 which complements the \wa. Both projects are part of the FIDO2 project.\footcite[See][169--170]{grimes2017hacking}

\subsection{Universal Authentication Framework}

The \glsfirst{uaf} is \gls{fido}'s solution for a passwordless experience. It uses local and native device authentication such as biometrics to authorize the user. It does not feature \gls{2fa}, but is instead meant as direct replacement for the login with passwords. It is based on public key cryptography with the use of challenge-response authentication.

It features three key components, the \gls{uaf} client, the \gls{uaf} server and the \gls{uaf} authenticators. Besides that, the alliance offers a metadata service. The communication between the client and the authenticator is done via the \gls{uaf} \gls{asm}, which offers a standardized solution for the client to access and detect the various different authenticators.

\subsection{Universal Second Factor}

\Gls{u2f} has also been renamed to \gls{ctap}1 since the release of the \wa{}.
