\section{History and evolution}

The \wa{} is an outcome of joint efforts from the \gls{fido} alliance and and the \gls{w3c}. It is a product from various preceding industry standards, namely \gls{uaf} and \gls{u2f}. This chapter introduces the origin of the \wa{} by explaining the origin of the \gls{fido} alliance and their works on the \gls{uaf} and \gls{u2f} with a focus of the technical implementations, protocols and used techniques.

\subsection{FIDO Alliance}

The \gls{fido} alliance is an open industry association founded in July 2012 and launched in February 2013. Companies such as PayPal, Lenovo, and Infineon founded the \gls{fido} alliance. Currently the alliance has more than 260 members, including, e.g., Google, Amazon, Yubico, Samsung, Microsoft, VISA, or MasterCard. The goal of the \gls{fido} alliance is to develop new authentication protocols and standards in order to enhance and simplify the user experience of \gls{mfa} and to reduce the over usage of passwords.\footcites[See][583]{eckert-it-sec-9}

The \gls{fido} alliance developed the specifications \gls{uaf} and \gls{u2f}. The first specification of the \gls{u2f} was the starting point for the development of the \wa{} in a joint efforts with the \gls{w3c}. The \gls{ctap} is based on the \gls{u2f} specification 1.2 which complements the \wa. Both projects are part of the FIDO2 project.
