\section{History and evolution}

The \wa{} is an outcome of joint efforts from the \gls{fido} alliance and and the \gls{w3c}. It is a product from various preceding industry standards, namely \gls{uaf} and \gls{u2f}. This chapter introduces the origin of the \wa{} by explaining the origin of the \gls{fido} alliance and their works on the \gls{uaf} and \gls{u2f} with a focus of the technical implementations, protocols and used techniques.

\subsection{FIDO Alliance}

The \gls{fido} alliance is an open industry association founded in July 2012 and launched in February 2013. Companies such as PayPal, Lenovo, and Infineon founded the \gls{fido} alliance. Currently the alliance has more than 260 members, including, e.g., Google, Amazon, Yubico, Samsung, Microsoft, VISA, or MasterCard. The goal of the \gls{fido} alliance is to develop new authentication protocols and standards in order to enhance and simplify the user experience of \gls{mfa} and to reduce the over usage of passwords.\footcites[See][583]{eckert-it-sec-9}

The \gls{fido} alliance developed the specifications \gls{uaf} and \gls{u2f}. The first specification of the \gls{u2f} was the starting point for the development of the \wa{} in a joint efforts with the \gls{w3c}. The \gls{ctap} is based on the \gls{u2f} specification 1.2 which complements the \wa. Both projects are part of the FIDO2 project.\footcite[See][169--170]{grimes2017hacking}

\subsection{Universal Authentication Framework}

The \glsfirst{uaf} is \gls{fido}'s solution for a passwordless experience. It uses local and native device authentication such as biometrics to authorize the user. It does not feature \gls{2fa}, but is instead meant as direct replacement for the login with passwords. It is based on public key cryptography with the use of challenge-response authentication. The goal of the \gls{uaf} is to provide a generic \gls{api} which enables interoperability and a unified user experience between the different operating systems and clients.

It features three key components, the \textit{\gls{uaf} client}, the \textit{\gls{uaf} server}, and the \textit{\gls{uaf} authenticators}. Besides that, the alliance offers a metadata service. The communication between the client and the authenticator is done via the \gls{uaf} \gls{asm}, which offers a standardized solution for the client to access and detect the various different authenticators. Each authenticator is identified by the \gls{aaid}, a model unique ID that consist of the vendor and model ID, where the vendor ID is centrally assigned by the \gls{fido} alliance.

\autoref{fig:uaf_architecture} shows the \gls{uaf} architecture, where the client and user device are responsible for the communication between the authenticator, the \gls{fido} client and the corresponding web browser or (mobile) app, also called the user agent. The relying party, mostly a web server and \gls{fido} are responsible for secure communication of the \gls{uaf} protocol between the \gls{fido} client and server, as well as authenticator validation and the user authentication. The metadata service updates the database of approved, genuine and certificated authenticators that the server keeps. The protocol defines four different uses cases, which are explained in more detail below:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item registration of the authenticator
	\item user authentication
	\item de-registration of the authenticator
	\item transaction confirmation
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Registration}

The registration process contains different steps. The \gls{fido} server generates a policy object which contains allowed and disallowed authenticators, and sends it together with the server challenge, username, and the AppID, the origin, to the client. The client checks that the given AppID matches the requested server and begins to process the of the registration. At first the \gls{fcp} is generated by hashing the server challenge and the AppID. Subsequently the \gls{asm} computes the KHAccessToken, an access control mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to the authenticator. It consists of the AppID, ASMToken (a randomly generated and maintained secret by the \gls{asm}, PersonaID (a unique ID for each \gls{os} user account), and the CallerID (the assigned ID of the \gls{os} for the \gls{fido} client). Once the \gls{fcp} and KHAccessToken are generated, the client sends the \gls{fcp}, hashed KHAccessToken, and username to the authenticator. After receiving the data, the authenticator presents the data to the user (e.g., the AppID) and asks for a verification. When the user has been verified and approved the request, the authenticator generates a new key-pair and stores it along with the KHAccessToken and username in its secure storage. After that, a KRD is sent back to the clinet, which contains the \gls{aaid}, a general counter, a registration counter, the hashed \gls{fcp}, the public key and the attestation cert. Besides that, a signature over the values \gls{aaid}, hashed \gls{fcp}, counters and the public key is generated. Finally, when the \gls{fido} server receives the registration request (KRD and signature) back, it can cryptographically verify the data by checking the sent signature, the attestation certificate, the \gls{aaid} of the authenticator and the hash of the final challenge. Ultimately the sever stores the public key in the database.

\subsection{Universal Second Factor}

The \glsfirst{u2f} is the second standard developed by the \gls{fido} alliance before the \wa. It explicitly defines the use of a second factor for the password-based login flow which is backed by public-key cryptography. It's contributed by Google and Yubico, both being alliance members. The \textit{strong second factor} can be either connected or disconnected, e.g, built in hardware or for instance an \gls{usb} token, \gls{nfc}-capable device or a standalone \gls{ble} dongle. The protocol defines two layers:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item the first defines the cryptographic basics of the protocol
	\item the second layer defines the communication between the user's authenticator and the first layer over the chosen transport protocol (e.g., \gls{usb}, \gls{nfc}, or \gls{ble}
\end{enumerate}

Besides that, the \gls{u2f} protocol only specifies \gls{usb}, both internal and external \gls{hid} devices, \gls{nfc} and Bluetooth, as well as the low energy variant, \gls{ble}, as possible transport protocols.

\footcites[See][1--2, 4]{u2f-overview}[See][4]{u2f-js-api}

Further, \gls{u2f} has also been renamed to \gls{ctap}1 since the release of the \wa{} to avoid confusion and better understanding that it is usable with the \wa{} as a \gls{ctap}.

\subsection{FIDO2}

\subsubsection{Client to Authenticator Protocol 2}

\subsubsection{Web Authentication API}

The \wa{} is backwards compatible to the \gls{u2f} compatible, thus making every security token that is usable for \gls{u2f} compatible with the \wa, too.
