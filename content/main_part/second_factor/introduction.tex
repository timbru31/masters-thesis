\section{Transmission of information}

A key aspect to take into account is the chosen transmission channel for the second or different (multi) factor. \gls{oob} transmission helps to reduce the risks of eavesdropping drastically. This technique describes the transmission of information on another channel or network than the current transmission of information is happening. While, e.g., the \textit{normal} transmission of information on websites happens via the internet, an  example for \gls{oob} transmission is the phone call or SMS to transmit the second factor.
