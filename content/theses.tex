	\item The status quo of password usage is problematic. Often chosen passwords are re-used and weak.
	\item Humans are the weakest link in a phishing scenario. Social engineering attacks can even target the service provider.
	\item \Glsdesc{mfa} is not phishing resistant, both the secret when setting it up and the second factor can be phished or stolen. Software solutions are more probable to be phished.
	\item The biggest threat to \glsdesc{mfa} is transportation, especially when using \gls{sms} or unencrypted e-mail traffic.
	\item \Glsdesc{mfa} can be made phishing resistant, but it requires more effort to do so by choosing different transportation algorithms.
	\item The \wa{} is not yet usable enough nor widely adopted. This is, in particular true, for iOS and the Internet Explorer.
	\item The user needs to be educated about passwords, the risk of password re-use, phishing, and how to protect themselves against typical internet threats.
