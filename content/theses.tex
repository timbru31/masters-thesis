	\item The status quo of password usage is bad, often chosen passwords are re-used and weak.
	\item Humans are the weakest link.
	\item \gls{2fa} is not phishing resistent, both the secret when setting it up and the second factor can be phished or stolen. Software solutions are more probable to be phished.
	\item The biggest threat to \gls{2fa} is the transportation especially when using SMS or unencrypted e-mail traffic.
	\item \gls{mfa} can made be phishing resistant but it requires more effort to do so.	
	\item \wa{} is not yet usable enough nor widely adopted, this is especially true because iOS lacks support for it and the Internet Explorer is still widely used.
	\item The user needs to be educated about passwords, the risk of password re-use, phishing and how to protect themselves against common (internet) threats.
