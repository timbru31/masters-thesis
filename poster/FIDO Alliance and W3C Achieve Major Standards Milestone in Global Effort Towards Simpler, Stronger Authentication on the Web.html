    <p id="desc"><a href="https://www.w3.org/">https://www.w3.org/</a> and Mountain
    View, Calif.  — 10 April 2018 —
    The <a href="http://www.fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> and
    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium
    (W3C)</a> have achieved a major standards milestone in the global
    effort to bring simpler yet stronger web authentication to users
    around the world. The W3C has
    advanced <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2018/CR-webauthn-20180320/">Web
    Authentication (WebAuthn)</a>, a collaborative effort based on Web
    API specifications submitted by FIDO to the W3C, to the Candidate
    Recommendation (CR) stage. The CR is the product of
    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/webauthn/">Web Authentication
    Working Group</a>, which is comprised of representatives
    from <a href="https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=87227&amp;order=org&amp;public=1">over
    30 member organizations</a>. CR is a precursor to final approval
    of a web standard, and the W3C has invited online services and web
    app developers
    to <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6921">implement
    WebAuthn</a>.
    </p>
    <p>WebAuthn defines a standard web API that can be incorporated
    into browsers and related web platform infrastructure which gives
    users new methods to securely authenticate on the web, in the
    browser and across sites and devices. WebAuthn has been developed
    in coordination with FIDO Alliance and is a core component of the
    <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2">FIDO2 Project</a> along with
    FIDO’s <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/download/">Client to
    Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)</a> specification. CTAP enables an
    external authenticator, such as a security key or a mobile phone,
    to communicate strong authentication credentials locally over USB,
    Bluetooth or NFC to the user's internet access device (PC or
    mobile phone). The FIDO2 specifications collectively enable users
    to authenticate easily to online services with desktop or mobile
    devices with phishing-resistant security.
    </p>
    <p>"<i>With the new FIDO2 specifications and leading web browser
    support announced today, we are taking a big step forward towards
    making FIDO Authentication ubiquitous across all platforms and
    devices,</i>" said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO
    Alliance. "<i>After years of increasingly severe data breaches and
    password credential theft, now is the time for service providers
    to end their dependency on vulnerable passwords and
    one-time-passcodes and adopt phishing-resistant FIDO
    Authentication for all websites and applications.</i>"</p>
    <p>Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla have committed to supporting the
    WebAuthn standard in their flagship browsers and have started
    implementation for Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS and Android
    platforms. Both
    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2018/CR-webauthn-20180320/">WebAuthn</a>
    and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/download/">CTAP</a>
    specifications are available today, enabling developers and
    vendors to get a jumpstart on building support for the next
    generation of FIDO Authentication into their products and
    services.</p>
    <p>"<i>Security on the web has long been a problem which has
    interfered with the many positive contributions the web makes to
    society. While there are many web security problems and we can't
    fix them all, relying on passwords is one of the weakest
    links. With WebAuthn's multi-factor solutions we are eliminating
    this weak link,</i>" stated W3C CEO Jeff Jaffe. "<i>WebAuthn will change
    the way that people access the Web.</i>"</p>
    <p>The completion of the FIDO2 standardization efforts, promotion
    of WebAuthn along the W3C standards track, and the commitment of
    leading browser vendors to implementation opens a new era of
    ubiquitous, hardware-backed FIDO Authentication protection for
    everyone using the internet.</p>
    <p>Enterprises and online service providers looking to protect
    themselves and their customers from the risks associated with
    passwords — including phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks and the
    abuse of stolen credentials — can soon deploy standards-based
    strong authentication that works through the browser or via an
    external authenticator. Deploying FIDO Authentication enables
    online services to provide choice to users from an interoperable
    ecosystem of devices people use every day like mobile phones and
    security keys.</p>  
    <p>The standardization of the new FIDO2 specifications in browsers
    and operating systems will further expand the reach of FIDO
    Authentication, which is referenced by regulators and
    standards-setting bodies worldwide and is already available on
    hundreds of millions of devices and offered to more than 3.5
    billion user accounts worldwide through services from companies
    such as Google, Facebook, NTT DOCOMO, Bank of America and many
    more. The new specifications complement existing passwordless FIDO
    UAF and second-factor FIDO U2F use cases, and expand the
    availability of FIDO Authentication. FIDO2 web browsers and online
    services are fully backwards compatible with all previously
    certified FIDO Security Keys.</p>
    <p>FIDO will soon launch interoperability testing and will issue
    certifications for servers, clients and authenticators adhering to
    FIDO2 specifications. The conformance test tools are available on
    FIDO’s <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/test-tool-access-request/">website</a>. Additionally,
    FIDO will introduce a new Universal Server certification for
    servers that interoperate with all FIDO authenticator types (FIDO
    UAF, FIDO U2F, WebAuthn, CTAP).</p>
    <h3>WebAuthn and FIDO2 Project Benefits</h3>
    <p>W3C’s WebAuthn API, a standard web API that can be incorporated
    into browsers and related web platform infrastructure, enables
    strong, unique, public key-based credentials for each site,
    eliminating the risk that a password stolen from one site can be
    used on another. A web application running in a browser loaded on
    a device with a FIDO Authenticator can easily call to a public API
    to enable simpler, stronger FIDO Authentication of users with
    cryptographic operations in place of, or in addition to password
    exchange, delivering many advantages to service providers and
    users alike:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Simpler authentication</b>: users simply log in with a
      single gesture using:
	<ul>
	  <li>Internal or built-in authenticators (such as fingerprint
	  or facial biometrics) in PCs, laptops and/or mobile
	  devices</li>
	  <li>Convenient external authenticators, such as security
	  keys and mobile devices, for device-to-device authentication
	  using CTAP, a protocol for external authenticators developed
	  by the FIDO Alliance that complements WebAuthn</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Stronger authentication</b>: FIDO Authentication is much
      stronger than relying only on passwords and related forms of
      authentication, and has these advantages:
	<ul>
	  <li>User credentials and biometric templates never leave the
	  user’s device and are never stored on servers</li>
	  <li>Accounts are protected from phishing,
	  man-in-the-middle and replay attacks that use stolen
	  passwords</li>
	</ul>
      </li><li><b>Developers</b> can get started on creating apps and
	services that leverage FIDO Authentication on FIDO’s new
	<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/participate/developers/">developer
	resources page</a>.</li>
      
    </ul>
    <h2>About the FIDO Alliance</h2>
    <p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance,
    <a href="https://www.fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>,
    was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability
    among <a href="https://www.fidoalliance.org/specifications/">strong
    authentication</a> technologies, and remedy the problems users
    face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and
    passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of
    authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication
    that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms
    that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO authentication is
    stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online
    services.</p>
    <h2>About the World Wide Web Consortium</h2>
    <p>The mission of the World Wide Web Consortium
    (W3C), <a href="https://www.w3.org/">www.w3.org</a>, is to lead
    the Web to its full potential by creating technical standards and
    guidelines to ensure that the Web remains open, accessible, and
